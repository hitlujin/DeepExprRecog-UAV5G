# Deep Network Expression Recognition with Transfer Learning in UAV-enabled B5G/6G Networks

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation code for the paper titled "Deep Network Expression Recognition with Transfer Learning in UAV-enabled B5G/6G Networks." The paper proposes an innovative approach to applying deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for facial expression recognition tailored for UAV applications in B5G/6G networks. By leveraging transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques, our method efficiently utilizes pre-trained models on large-scale facial attribute datasets, which are then fine-tuned on specific facial expression datasets.

## Key Contributions
- **Efficiency in Training:** Reduces the number of training iterations required on facial expression datasets, thus saving time and computational resources.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves a facial expression recognition accuracy of 97.6%, outperforming traditional methods that rely solely on facial expression datasets.
- **Real-time Application:** Especially designed for UAVs, the method supports real-time expression recognition, which can be pivotal in scenarios like crowd monitoring, search and rescue operations, and interactive human-UAV communication.

## Model Strategy
1. **Initial Training:** The model is initially trained on a large-scale facial attribute dataset, which provides a robust foundation due to its relevance to facial expressions.
2. **Fine-Tuning:** Subsequent fine-tuning on a facial expression dataset enhances the model's accuracy and adaptability to specific expression recognition tasks.
